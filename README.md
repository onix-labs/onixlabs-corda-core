# ONIXLabs Corda Core

ONIXLabs Corda Core provides Corda developers with a suite of APIs to empower development of CorDapps, and also serves as the foundation for all of the ONIXLabs Corda Frameworks and APIs.

Whilst the ONIXLabs Corda Core API isn't intended to be used as a CorDapp (it doesn't have any of it's own states and/or contracts), it's partitioned into contract, workflow and integration layers for simplicty, and is signed with the ONIXLabs key.

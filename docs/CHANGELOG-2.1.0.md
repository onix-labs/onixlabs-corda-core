# Change Log - Version 2.1.0

This document serves as the change log for the ONIXLabs Corda Core API.

## Release Notes

This release contains several API improvements for workflow design and composability. Typically when writing flows, we find ourselves repeating a lot of boilerplate code for flow initialisation, transaction composition, verifying, signing, counter-signing and finalising. The APIs in this release move much of that boilerplate code into helpful extension functions, making your flows much more succinct and easier to read.

ðŸ”µ **INFORMATION**

This API updates the underlying Corda dependencies from 4.6 to 4.8 (LTS).

Provides a DSL-like transaction builder.

```kotlin
@Suspendable
fun FlowLogic<*>.buildTransaction(
  notary: Party,

): TransactionBuilder
```

#### Remarks

To use this function, `BuildTransactionStep` will need to be evident in your progress tracker.

---

### verifyTransaction _Extension Function_

**Module:** onixlabs-corda-core-workflow

**Package:** io.onixlabs.corda.core.workflow

Verifies a transaction.

```kotlin
@Suspendable

```

#### Remarks

To use this function, `VerifyTransactionStep` will need to be evident in your progress tracker.

---

### signTransaction _Extension Function_

**Module:** onixlabs-corda-core-workflow

Signs a transaction.

```kotlin
@Suspendable
fun FlowLogic<*>.signTransaction(transaction: TransactionBuilder): SignedTransaction
```

#### Remarks

To use this function, `SignTransactionStep` will need to be evident in your progress tracker.

---

### collectSignatures _Extension Function_

**Module:** onixlabs-corda-core-workflow

**Package:** io.onixlabs.corda.core.workflow

Collects all remaining required signatures from the specified counter-parties.

```kotlin
@Suspendable
fun FlowLogic<*>.collectSignatures(
    transaction: SignedTransaction,
    sessions: Iterable<FlowSession>,
    additionalSigningAction: ((SignedTransaction) -> SignedTransaction)? = null
): SignedTransaction
```

#### Remarks

To use this function, `CollectTransactionSignaturesStep` will need to be evident in your progress tracker.

Due to the way this function works, it is intended to be paired with `collectSignaturesHandler` in the counter-flow. This function will filter out all required signing sessions from the sessions provided, and will then notify all sessions whether they are required to sign or not. For those sessions required to sign, it will collect their signature.

---

### collectSignaturesHandler _Extension Function_

**Module:** onixlabs-corda-core-workflow

**Package:** io.onixlabs.corda.core.workflow

Signs a transaction.

```kotlin
@Suspendable
fun FlowLogic<*>.collectSignaturesHandler(
    session: FlowSession,
    action: (SignedTransaction) -> Unit = {}
): SignedTransaction?
```

#### Remarks

To use this function, `SignTransactionStep` will need to be evident in your progress tracker.

Due to the way this function works, it is intended to be paired with `collectSignatures` in the initiating flow.

---

### finalizeTransaction _Extension Function_

**Module:** onixlabs-corda-core-workflow

**Package:** io.onixlabs.corda.core.workflow

Finalizes a transaction.

```kotlin
@Suspendable
fun FlowLogic<*>.finalizeTransaction(
    transaction: SignedTransaction,
    statesToRecordBySession: StatesToRecordBySession,
    ourStatesToRecord: StatesToRecord = StatesToRecord.ONLY_RELEVANT
): SignedTransaction
```

#### Remarks

To use this function, `SendStatesToRecordStep` and `FinalizeTransactionStep` will need to be evident in your progress tracker.

This function allows the initiator to specify how counter-parties should record states of the finalized transaction. For each session of the `statesToRecordBySession` object, the counter-party will receive their `StatesToRecord` enumeration, unless they have specified an override via the `finalizeTransactionHandler` function. Finally they will record the finalized transaction.

---

### finalizeTransaction _Extension Function_

**Module:** onixlabs-corda-core-workflow

**Package:** io.onixlabs.corda.core.workflow

Finalizes a transaction.

```kotlin
@Suspendable
fun FlowLogic<*>.finalizeTransaction(
    transaction: SignedTransaction,
    sessions: Iterable<FlowSession>,
    counterpartyStatesToRecord: StatesToRecord = StatesToRecord.ONLY_RELEVANT,
    ourStatesToRecord: StatesToRecord = StatesToRecord.ONLY_RELEVANT
): SignedTransaction
```

#### Remarks

To use this function, `SendStatesToRecordStep` and `FinalizeTransactionStep` will need to be evident in your progress tracker.

This function allows the initiator to specify how counter-parties should record states of the finalized transaction. Each session will record the transaction states according to the `counterpartyStatesToRecord` parameter, unless they have specified an override via the `finalizeTransactionHandler` function. Finally they will record the finalized transaction.

---

### finalizeTransactionHandler _Extension Function_

**Module:** onixlabs-corda-core-workflow

```kotlin
@Suspendable
fun FlowLogic<*>.finalizeTransactionHandler(
    session: FlowSession,
    expectedTransactionId: SecureHash? = null,
    statesToRecord: StatesToRecord? = null
): SignedTransaction
```

#### Remarks

To use this function, `ReceiveStatesToRecordStep` and `RecordFinalizedTransactionStep` will need to be evident in your progress tracker.

This function will first receive the `StatesToRecord` from the initiating node, however this can be overridden using the `statesToRecord` parameter. Finally the transaction will be received and recorded.

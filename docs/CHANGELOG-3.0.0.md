**Module:** onixlabs-corda-core-contract

**Package:** io.onixlabs.corda.core.contract

#### Description

Represents an array of unsigned bytes, and its signed equivalent.

```kotlin
@CordaSerializable
data class SignatureData(
    val content: ByteArray, 
    val signature: DigitalSignature
)
```

>   ðŸ”µ  **INFORMATION**
>
>   This API exists in version 1.2.0 however in version 3.0.0 the `verify` function no longer returns `Boolean`. Instead, the `isValid` function replaces the `verify` function, and the `verify` function now returns `Unit`, or throws a `SignatureException` if the digital signature could not be verified by the specified public key.

# ONIXLabs Corda Core

ONIXLabs Corda Core provides Corda developers with a suite of APIs to empower development of CorDapps, and also serves as the foundation for all of the ONIXLabs Corda Frameworks and APIs.

Whilst the ONIXLabs Corda Core API isn't a CorDapp in it's own right, it is partitioned into contract, workflow and integration layers for simplicity.

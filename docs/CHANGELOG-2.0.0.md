# Change Log - Version 2.0.0

This document serves as the change log for the ONIXLabs Corda Core API.

## Release Notes

#### ðŸ”´ WARNING

**This release contains breaking changes from version 1.2.0 and is not backwards compatible.**

This release contains several new APIs and some API changes; including:

-   A set of APIs for obtaining underlying generic type information, used within this API and beyond.
-   A model for creating one-to-one and one-to-many state relationships.
-   A query parameter model for improved vault query capability.
-   A reference CorDapp which implements, demonstrates and tests the features of this API.

#### ðŸ”µ INFORMATION

As of version 1.0.0, packaged releases of this API has been signed with the ONIXLabs production signing key. Historically, clones of this repository would have failed to build, since the ONIXLabs production signing key is a secret. Version 2.0.0 ships with the ONIXLabs developer key, allowing this repository to be cloned, built and tested locally.

### TypeInfo _Class_

**Module:** onixlabs-corda-core-contract

**Package:** io.onixlabs.corda.core

Represents a graph of type information about a generic type.

```kotlin
class TypeInfo<T> private constructor(val typeClass: Class<T>, val typeArguments: List<TypeInfo<*>>)
```

---

### TypeReference _Abstract Class_

**Module:** onixlabs-corda-core-contract

**Package:** io.onixlabs.corda.core

Represents a type reference which obtains full generic type information for the underlying generic type.

```kotlin
abstract class TypeReference<T> : Comparable<TypeReference<T>>
```

>   ðŸ”µ  **INFORMATION**
>
>   This implementation is inspired by the `TypeReference<T>` class in [fasterxml, jackson-core](https://fasterxml.github.io/jackson-core/javadoc/2.8/com/fasterxml/jackson/core/type/TypeReference.html).

---

### typeReference _Function_

**Module:** onixlabs-corda-core-contract

**Package:** io.onixlabs.corda.core

Creates a type reference of the reified generic type.

```kotlin
inline fun <reified T> typeReference(): TypeReference<T>
```

---

### getTypeArguments _Extension Function_

**Module:** onixlabs-corda-core-contract

**Package:** io.onixlabs.corda.core

Gets the argument types from a generic superclass.

```kotlin
fun Class<*>.getArgumentTypes(): List<Type>
```

---

### getTypeArgument _Extension Function_

**Module:** onixlabs-corda-core-contract

**Package:** io.onixlabs.corda.core

Gets an argument type from a generic superclass.

```kotlin
fun Class<*>.getArgumentType(index: Int): Type
```

---

### toClass _Extension Function_

**Module:** onixlabs-corda-core-contract

**Package:** io.onixlabs.corda.core

```

---

### toTypedClass _Extension Function_

**Module:** onixlabs-corda-core-contract

**Package:** io.onixlabs.corda.core

Converts a type to a class.

---

### AbstractPluralResolvable _Class_

**Module:** onixlabs-corda-core-contract

**Package:** io.onixlabs.corda.core.contract

Represents the base class for implementing plural (one-to-many) contract state resolvers.

```kotlin
abstract class AbstractPluralResolvable<T> : PluralResolvable<T> where T : ContractState
```

#### Remarks

Corda states are persisted to a relational database, however due to the nature of the ledger and the way states are created, evolved and spent, it's hard to model relational data with states. This brings Corda one step closer, allowing Corda states to model one-to-many relationships with other Corda states. To model a one-to-one state relationship, see `SingularResolvable<T>` and `AbstractSingularResolvable<T>`.

---

### AbstractSingularResolvable _Class_

**Module:** onixlabs-corda-core-contract

**Package:** io.onixlabs.corda.core.contract

Represents the base class for implementing singular (one-to-one) contract state resolvers.

```kotlin
abstract class AbstractSingularResolvable<T> : SingularResolvable<T> where T : ContractState
```

#### Remarks

Corda states are persisted to a relational database, however due to the nature of the ledger and the way states are created, evolved and spent, it's hard to model relational data with states. This brings Corda one step closer, allowing Corda states to model one-to-one relationships with other Corda states. To model a one-to-many state relationship, see `PluralResolvable<T>` and `AbstractPluralResolvable<T>`.

---

### PluralResolvable _Interface_

**Module:** onixlabs-corda-core-contract

**Package:** io.onixlabs.corda.core.contract

>   ðŸ”´ **WARNING**
>
>   **This API is not backwards compatible!**
>
>   This API exists in version 1.0.0 and was originally called `Resolvable<T>` however in version 2.0.0 the model has been extended to support one-to-one, and one-to-many relationships.
